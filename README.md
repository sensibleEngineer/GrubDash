# GrubDash
In this simulation project, I am a backend developer for a startup company, setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas to practice building APIs with complex validation.

<b> These are the main objectives:</b>

- Use common middleware packages<br />
- Receive requests through routes<br />
- Accessing relevant information through route parameters<br />
- Building an API following RESTful design principles<br />
- Writing custom middleware functions
